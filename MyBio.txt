6 weeks at SSA

I did IT support for a small counseling company at my last job where I also did some very minor HTML and CSS work. I also took an Intro to C++ class as well as an Intro to Web Design class in college. I did not start Java and OOP until three weeks ago, so my experience with Java and OOP is limited.
